# Objetivo desse projeto

Criar uma biblioteca pessoal de filmes, onde eu posso adicionar um filme que eu assisti e avaliá-lo, separando por gênero e impondo um avaliação de 0 a 5.

Até 09/05 para a primeira entrega eu montei o formulário e um css bem breve, ainda não é funcional, mas meu objetivo para a próxima entrega é conseguir salvar e então adicionar na tal biblioteca, talvez um menu lateral.

Não vou criar banco de dados, então vai ser apenas salvo enquanto a aplicação está rodando.

Atualização para 16/05 eu não consegui fazer o salvamento do formulário, tive algumas tentativas mas ainda sem sucesso, por isso vou apresentar apenas a reorganização dos componentes, pois deixei cada etapa do formulário em componentes separados, juntando depois em um só.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
